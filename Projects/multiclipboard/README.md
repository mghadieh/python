# Overview

This project is to allow multiple items to co-exists on the computer clipboard.

## Usage

- `mutliclipboard.py` takes a mandatory text parameter, thus it is best to be run from the command line
- The three parameters are:
  - load: this will ask the user to load a saved item to the clipboard
  - save: this will save an item on the clipboard
  - list: this will list all the items that are saved and available for load
