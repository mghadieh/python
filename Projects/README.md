# Overview

Here you will find different projects build using Python 3.

# Structure

Some projects are grouped under one folder because they have one main attribute in common, e.g. GUI project folder contains GUI projects. Others, are under a folder with a descriptive name, e.g. Madlibs folder conatains a Mad libs game written in Python. The next section will give you a brief overlook of what to expect.

**_Note_**: the projects under `.\CourseraProjects` (except for GUI), use some built in function on the platform used in Coursera. The reason they are being showcased here is to show the different libraries I used to build them.
