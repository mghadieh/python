# Overview

**Welcome to my Python Repo.**

Here you will find all the projects, exercises and scripts I've worked on over the years. I first started learning Python because I had free time after work and wanted to go into Data Analytics and then Data Engineering. After taking few courses on coursera and obtaining multiple certificates of completion, I've become a big fan of the language. I decided that I wanted to continue learning, building and advancing my pythonic experience. I started learning how to build GUI applications, ML, some AI, and ofcourse, solving HackerRank problems.

**Thank you for stopping by :)**
